	<h1>about</h1>
    <p>together we are better. is an organization committed to spreading the word that, through our oneness in Christ, together we are better.</p>
    <p>ecclesiastes 4:9-12</p>
    <small>
        <p>two are better than one,</p>
        <p>because they have a good return for their labor:</p>
        <p>if either of them falls down,</p>
        <p>one can help the other up.</p>
        <p>but pity anyone who falls</p>
        <p>and has no one to help them up.</p>
        <p>also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.</p>
        <p>but how can one keep warm alone?</p>
        <p>though one may be overpowered,</p>
        <p>two can defend themselves.</p>
        <p>a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</p>
